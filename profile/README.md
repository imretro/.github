# Imretro

Imretro is an image format meant to mimic the experience of making a retro game. It is
intended to be relatively simple to write manually with a hex editor or a custom-made
tool. It supports several combinations of settings to manage the number of bits (not bytes!)
used for pixels and the palette.
